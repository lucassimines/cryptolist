### Hello Andrew,

In the application for the technical test at Fanwave, I applied my knowledge in Vue to a WordPress application with the Roots Sage theme. I developed all the components and functions.

I used Typescript for better security and typing in the application, which is essential in development.

Regarding the application's design, I applied my design concepts, aiming to create an interface that is user-friendly. All elements are properly aligned, with a clean design and full responsiveness.

I used Blade for the Layout, Header, Footer, and the Vue content is rendered within the div inside the vueapp.blade.php partial.

#### Technologies:
- Vue 3
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- Wordpress
- Roots Sage theme
- Laravel Mix
